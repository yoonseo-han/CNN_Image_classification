# COMP2211 PA2 Image Classification using CNN

## Introduction

Build a CNN image classification model using the Keras library, which is a simplified set of API<a href="#API"><sup>1</sup></a> on top of the famous TensorFlow library.
The links to the documentation of each task's relevant function are provided in the task description.
You can generally refer to them to see how to call each Keras functions.

In addition, Keras provides multiple coding paradigms and API patterns for some functions.
And some are not comprehensively documented!
(E.g. string shorthands for activation functions, kernel initializers, losses, etc.)
